Surprising points:
Blue, yellow, red glowing dots are simple food, snake eats them and grow.
Other dots are special dots, if snake eats them, then it will be forced to do somthing:
Purple sphere: energy, stackable, after eating snake will speed up fo 2 seconds, without losing body parts.
Green sphere:poison,after eating snake will shrink for 2 seconds, with glowing effect, speed will be reseted afterwards.
Gray cube: stone, like boundary, hitting cause death.
